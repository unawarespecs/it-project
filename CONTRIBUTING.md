# (For other groupmates) Contributing

If you created (or edited) a page, add this in the header (between html opening tag and head tag)

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<!--
    [Page in website]
    Author: [Name]
    Contributors:
    [Add yourselves here]
    
    Date created: [Date]
-->

<head ...>
```

This isn't needed to be added but it is recommended to copy

This may be done so that our professor can check who contributed to the website.

## For first time contributors

If you want to help out to this project, even if you're a complete novice in group collaboration (like me), you can follow these to help out:

- Uploading images to the repo

If you have a Github account, click on Add file and click Upload files.

For example, you want to upload images. Click the images folder then click "add file" then "upload files".

![img1](/assets/img/img1.png)

Then you can drag and drop (or choose files), add a description so I know what to change in the website.

Then if you're done, click "commit changes".

![img2](/assets/img/img2.png)

- You can download the entire copy of the website source code by clicking on "Code" on the main repository page and then "Download ZIP".

![img3](/assets/img/img3.png)

- Then you can edit pages in Notepad++.

- If you want to upload changes, you may upload or edit existing files by opening the file you want to change (for ex. index.html) then click the pencil button.

![img4](/assets/img/img4.png)

- Then you can copy paste the entire edited file here, add a description or two, and then commit your changes.

It may be hard but it will be a good experience when you use this site for your own projects.
