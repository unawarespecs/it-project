# (For other groupmates) Contributing

If you are adding something to this page, add this in the header (between html opening tag and head tag)

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<!--
    [Page in website]
    Author: [Name]
    Contributors:
    [Add yourselves here]
    
    Date created: [Date]
-->

<head ...>
```

This isn't needed to be added but it is recommended to copy

This may be done so that our professor can check who contributed to the website.
