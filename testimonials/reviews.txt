(heading) Friendly and Clean
(review) Great experience to meet up with my friends and enjoy some great coffee. Clean restaurant, friendly staff and plenty of seats. Parking was easy and only meters from the front door. A must for coffee breaks.

(heading) Standard Starbucks branch
(review) Spending a few days in Pasig, I visited a few of the local eateries and coffee shops. Starbucks is always dependable for decent coffee and good service, so is my go to place when I just need a no thrills coffee.

(heading) Filipino Hospitality in this Starbucks Store
(review) My son and I were privileged to have passed by this Starbucks on our way to visit our family in Pasig. We met Jen who was a very efficient cashier. She was able to sign me up for the Christmas Tradition promotion and also got me a nice balikbayan Starbucks card that I can use - MALIGAYANG PASKO. Jen, Hayoee and Aymee took time to give us excellent customer service. The White Chocolate Mocha of my son and the Latte was excellent. The pasty that my son had was good. I highly recommend this store for size and location of venue and high customer service.

(heading) Not WiFi friendly.
(review) Overall it's what you'd expect from a Starbucks. If you are in the area, maybe go to Rockwell Business Center 1 building's Starbucks about a block away near Medical City and it's a more WiFi friendly experience. Also have Apple Fritters, well maybe they are banana fritters now...
This place at Metrowalk is a great place to meet friends because it's known to just about everyone from the area. I suppose one really good thing is you can leave your car at one of the auto garages to get work done and go to either of the Starbucks I've mentioned.
Lots of seating for smokers outside. There does tend to be a nuisance here with marketing people going on and on next to you.

(heading) Classic location...
(review) This is a cozy environment. Its like stepping in a different dimension. The classic wall designs, the high ceiling and the atmosphere is just worth your next stop over for caffeine. Staff are nice and friendly. The crowd is good - mostly from corporate offices nearby and guests from hotels around.

(heading) Friendliest staff and good coffee
(review) Was in town for business and had to visit the Global Visa Centre, could not take the hustle and bustle of Manila, fortunately found my sanctuary in Starbucks about 7 mins walk from the Visa centre. The staff are attentive and their attention to detail is noteworthy. Coffee is also great. The staff make this place very inviting. Their grande coffee is huge and only wish I could try the Midnight Mocha.
The address quoted in the review maybe wrong as the building is Allegro Centre, Pasong Tamo Extension
Thank you to the staff for making me feel very welcomed
