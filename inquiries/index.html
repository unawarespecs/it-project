                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
                <h6>1. How can I comment or give feedback about an experience I had in a Starbucks store?</h6>
                <p class="text-muted">We always welcome your feedback about our service and your in-store experience –
                    whether you found it friendly and helpful, or it fell short of your expectations.<br />

                    Please <a href="../contactform" class="text-black">Contact Us</a> with your comments
                    and we’ll respond as soon as possible. </p>

                <h6>2. How can I access WiFi in Starbucks stores?</h6>
                <p class="text-muted">When you're at Starbucks, you can stay connected to your world with
                    WiFi service from our friends at Google™.<br />
                    To log on, simply select "Google Starbucks" WiFi network, and when the Starbucks WiFi landing page
                    loads, complete the fields, and click "Accept & Connect."<br />
                    If the Starbucks WiFi page does not pop up, open a browser, navigate to a website,
                    and you will be redirected to the WiFi landing page.
                </p>

                <h6>3. How do I get a free limited-edition Starbucks reusable red cup?</h6>
                <p class="text-muted">On November 18th, we'll be giving away limited edition Starbucks red cups with
                    purchase of any handcrafted holiday beverage. This offer is eligible for orders placed in-store, at
                    the drive-thru, or ordered ahead on the Starbucks app, curbside pickup and Starbucks Delivers with
                    Uber Eats.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Please know that this offer is while supplies last at participating stores and quantities are
                    limited. Unfortunately, we cannot see a stores inventory and once a store runs out - they are
                    completely out and will not receive additional inventory.
                </p>

                <h6>4. How do I qualify for a cup discount?</h6>
                <p class="text-muted">By bringing in any personal cup, you qualify for a Php .10 off cup discount
                    regardless of the size of the beverage. You will be charged for the closest cup size, but not larger
                    than the size of the personal cup.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    There is no discount if using our "for here" cups.
                </p>
                <h6>5. How do refills work?</h6>
                <p class="text-muted">At participating stores, you can use your registered Starbucks Card or Starbucks®
                    app to purchase a beverage and then present that same Starbucks Card or Starbucks account in the app
                    to get free refills of brewed coffee (hot, Iced Coffee or Cold Brew), and tea (hot or iced, not
                    including lemonade) during the same store visit regardless of the original beverage. Customers
                    without a registered account may purchase a refill at a reduced price.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Once you leave the store, your visit has ended, and any subsequent coffee or tea refill thereafter
                    would be considered a new purchase. Refills are not available in the Drive Thru.
                </p>

                <h6>6. Is Starbucks getting rid of straws completely?</h6>
                <p class="text-muted">No, Starbucks is not taking away straws completely. We're replacing our current
                    single-use plastic straws with a strawless lid for all iced coffee, tea and espresso beverages, and
                    offering a new straw made of alternative materials (such as paper or compostable plastic) for
                    Frappuccino beverages. These new straw options will also be available by request for customers who
                    prefer or need a straw - for any drink.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    More information about Starbucks announcement to eliminate straws in our stores by 2020 can be found

                </p>

                <h6>7. Is it safe to use reusable (personal) cups?</h6>
                <p class="text-muted">The health and safety of our customers and partners is always our top
                    priority.<br />
                    Starbucks developed a completely contactless, new method — eliminating any shared touch points
                    between the customer and Starbucks partners.<br />
                    The CDC’s guidance maintains there is no added risk of fomite transfer from using a reusable cup.
                </p>
